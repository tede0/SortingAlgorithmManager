# SortManagerMiniProject
You will assigned to a group of 3-4 for this project.

You will be building and unit testing a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:

The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from (Console)
Decision is given via the command line (Console.ReadLine() )
The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line
The program should then output:
- The unsorted randomly generated array
- The sort algorithm to be used
- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
- The time taken

You should include but are not limited to:

BubbleSort
MergeSort (iterative or recursive)
.NET library sort methods

You should use the MVC pattern to separate the IO (View) from the model, and the Factory Method pattern to generate the requested model classes.

Please create a private repo for your group, and invite Cathy (cathy-french) and Peter (PBellaby) to it.  Make sure that you commit regularly and merge regularly with meaningful messages. 

You will need a main branch plus feature or personal branches.  As you cannot create branch protection rules for private repos, you will need to enforce them yourselves.

Create a project board for your project, and add 6 columns - Backlog, in Progress, Ready for Group Review, Ready for Sprint Review, Done and Notes
 
In your Notes column, add a generic definition of Ready and Done for your user stories, and a generic Definition of done for your project.

Your repo must have a README - looks at the examples in Further Reading for format.

The first named person in each group is the ScrumMaster
